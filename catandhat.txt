 kids, Sally and Sam, whose mother was out. They were having a very dreary day, and then were graced with a surprise visit from a stranger, the Cat. He comes in, assures them their mom won't mind, and makes a very big mess. Before the Cat leaves, he cleans up his mess, and when Sam and Sally's mother returns home, nothing is amiss. The story ends with the question "What would YOU do, if your mother asked YOU?"


The Cat in the Hat is a book where an eccentric stranger (who's a cat!) comes into the house of two young children, Sally and Sam, who are having a very dull day. Their mother is out, and when the Cat comes in, he reassures the kids that their mother won't mind him or his tricks! This can offer an opportunity to talk about the first question set. You can discuss what trust is and who you can trust. It will be a concept that the kids will have been drilled about quite frequently, but hopefully the book will offer them a new vantage point. They'll be able to further develop why they have their opinions, not just what is right action in a strange situation.

The story continues as the Cat falls while trying to balance too many things, and drops everything that he was holding. While talking with the kids about this section of the book, you can draw on the second question set. They attempt to promote thought about who has responsibilities and why they do. Since children are often taught to not make a mess, it will offer them an opportunity to find their own reasons for why people keep telling them to be tidy.

The second issue that arises after the Cat drops what he was holding would be to discuss what wrongness is, and how we should respond to it. The third question set deals with this. The Cat is making decisions that are very careless, presumably to amuse the children and himself. However, some of the things he's doing are dangerous, and may not be acceptable to support. Should we laugh when people do wrong things to entertain us? Taking this approach can let the kids build off of their previous experiences, and can help them decide how they want to act when approached with 'wrong' behaviour.

The Cat, seeing that his last attempt to entertain was thwarted by his poor balance, tries another way to amuse the children. He brings in two friends, Thing One and Thing Two. These two Things make even more of a mess than the Cat did, and then the children's mother is seen coming home! This can bring up discussions about social expectations, which are in the fourth question set. You could talk about what is appropriate behaviour, and how it differs between your home, and the home of a friend. Secondly, after their mom is seen, Sam decides that enough is enough. He decides to capture the Things. This readily introduces the kids to the concept of rudeness, and whether it's okay or not to be rude to someone. It will be a concept that stems from the book, but relates to their lives.

As the mom comes in, we as the reader are left with the question, would you tell your mom? With ending the book like this, Dr. Seuss creates a perfect scenario to discuss lying. These are questions found in the last question set. They hopefully create the scenario to clear up some ambiguity about lying. Can people can be hurt even if they never find out that you've lied? Since this draws on situations the kids would have been in (deciding to lie or not), they'll be able to draw concrete examples, which will help keep them engaged. If they seem to be having difficulty engaging, you might want to create a scenario where someone has lied, and get the kids to discuss whether it's okay or not (could be lying that you cheated, lying to a friend). A note of warning, it's important that if you talk about examples the kids bring up that you make sure not to go into too much detail, because there's a chance that this 'incident' could have involved others in the class. I think lying is an important topic to introduce in a discussion, because most people are simply told not to lie, and not shown the damage of lying. When kids come to their own conclusions, they are much more likely to stick to them in times of distress.

At the end of the story, the reader is left to wonder if they would tell their mom what had happened...

    * Would have you told your mother what happened? Why?
    * Is it okay to lie to hide something that you've done wrong?
    * If we lie and get away with it, can people still be hurt by what we've done?
    * Should we tell the truth, even if no one would believe us?
    * If you tell someone only part of what happened, is this lying?
